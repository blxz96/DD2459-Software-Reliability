# DD2459-Software-Reliability

This repository will record down what I have learnt and implemented as an exchange student taking the Masters level course DD2459 Software Reliability in KTH Royal Institute of Technology. 

The course covers the following topics:  

software testing concepts according to the V-model
graphical requirements modeling, including use case modeling
logical requirements modeling, including preconditions, postconditions and class invariants
graph coverage models
logic coverage models
input space partitioning
syntax based testing
reliability models
advanced topics such as automated and model based testing.
